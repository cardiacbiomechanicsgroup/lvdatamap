LV Data Map
================

Scripts to integrate imaging data into a left ventricle finite element mesh.

## Introduction
This project provides a generic pipeline for mapping imaging data onto a LV FE mesh. Specifically, the scripts project scar and mechanical activation information onto a FE mesh that can easily port to [FEBio](https://febio.org). 

## Data & Scripts
The data files needed to run the example scripts are uploaded on [SimTK.](https://simtk.org/projects/lvdatamap)

The scripts for mapping are hosted here on github.
